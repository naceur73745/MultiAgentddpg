I implemented the DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient) algorithm for a multi-agent setting, specifically on the Prisoner's Dilemma game. The objective of my project was to make DDPG work effectively in a multi-agent environment.

DDPG is a popular reinforcement learning algorithm that combines deep learning with policy gradient methods. It is well-suited for continuous action spaces and has been successfully applied to various single-agent reinforcement learning tasks. However, adapting DDPG to a multi-agent setting presented additional challenges and complexities.

In my project, I chose the Prisoner's Dilemma game as the testbed. This classic game in game theory demonstrates the tension between cooperation and self-interest. It involves two agents who have the choice to either cooperate or defect. The payoff matrix creates a scenario where both agents can benefit the most by defecting, but if both agents defect, they end up with a suboptimal outcome compared to if they had both cooperated.

To apply DDPG to the multi-agent Prisoner's Dilemma game, I made several modifications to the algorithm. Here are some key considerations and steps I took:

Environment Modeling: I defined the rules and dynamics of the Prisoner's Dilemma game, including how actions and rewards are determined based on the agents' choices.

Agent Representation: Each agent had its own actor and critic networks to learn and update its policy based on the DDPG algorithm. These networks took as input the agent's observation and outputted an action.

State Representation: In a multi-agent setting, the state representation typically includes the observations of all agents involved. The agents needed to observe and process the actions and observations of other agents to make informed decisions.

Exploration vs. Exploitation: Balancing exploration and exploitation was crucial in reinforcement learning. I incorporated exploration strategies to encourage agents to explore different actions while learning to maximize their rewards.

Policy Updates: The DDPG algorithm involves updating the actor and critic networks based on the observed rewards and the predicted Q-values. I extended this process to handle the multi-agent setting, where the critic network estimates the Q-values for each agent based on their joint actions.

Training and Optimization: Training the DDPG algorithm in a multi-agent setting required running multiple instances of the game simultaneously and updating the networks based on the experiences of all agents. I used optimization techniques like experience replay and target network updates to stabilize the learning process.

Evaluation: Once the DDPG algorithm was trained, I evaluated its performance on the multi-agent Prisoner's Dilemma game. This involved measuring metrics such as average reward, convergence of policies, and analyzing the agents' strategies in different scenarios.

By implementing DDPG for multi-agent settings on the Prisoner's Dilemma game, I aimed to explore the challenges of cooperative behavior and learn effective policies for the agents to maximize their long-term rewards. My project involved a combination of theoretical understanding, algorithm implementation, experimentation, and analysis to evaluate the performance and behavior of the multi-agent DDPG model.
